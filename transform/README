Program does not generate error states for erroneous input, merely producing unusual output.
Line limit is 1024 characters.

Text2Ascii is a program for generating unit test text files. I tend to use transform.c's own source code.

The program supports taking in strings like the assignment says, but it just acts to re-print the characters within
the string. No escaping is supported.
